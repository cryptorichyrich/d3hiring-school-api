Below is a sample README.md file tailored to the NodeJS API assessment you provided. This assumes a basic project structure and includes instructions for installation, running the API locally, and testing the endpoints. It also mentions optional deployment and a Postman collection, aligning with the requirements.

----------

Teacher-Student API

This is a NodeJS-based API designed to allow teachers to perform administrative functions for their students, such as registering students, retrieving common students, suspending students, and determining notification recipients. The API uses MySQL as its database and includes unit tests for validation.

Hosted API (Optional)

-   API Base URL: (e.g., https://d3hiring.up.railway.app)  
    (Replace with actual deployment URL if deployed)
    

Prerequisites

Before running the API locally, ensure you have the following installed:

-   Node.js: v16.x or higher
    
-   MySQL: v8.x or higher
    
-   Git: For cloning the repository
    

Installation

1.  Clone the Repository
    
    bash
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/teacher-student-api.git
    cd teacher-student-api
    ```
    
2.  Install Dependencies
    
    bash
    
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    
3.  Set Up the Database
    
    -   Create a MySQL database (e.g., teacher_student_db).
        
    -   Update the .env file with your database credentials (see .env.example for reference).
        
    -   Run the SQL schema file to set up tables:
        
        bash
        
        ```bash
        mysql -u yourusername -p teacher_student_db < db/schema.sql
        ```
        
4.  Configure Environment Variables
    
    -   Copy .env.example to .env:
        
        bash
        
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
        
    -   Update .env with your MySQL credentials:
        
        ```text
        DB_HOST=localhost
        DB_USER=yourusername
        DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
        DB_NAME=teacher_student_db
        PORT=3000
        ```
        

Running the API Locally

1.  Start the Server
    
    bash
    
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    
    The API will be available at http://localhost:3000 (or the port specified in .env).
    
2.  Verify the Server is Running Open your browser or a tool like Postman and navigate to http://localhost:3000/api/health (a simple health check endpoint, if implemented).
    

Testing the Endpoints

Running Unit Tests

-   Unit tests are written using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/). To run the tests:
    
    bash
    
    ```bash
    npm test
    ```
    
-   Tests cover the core functionality of each endpoint, including edge cases and error handling.
    

Manual Testing

You can test the API endpoints using tools like Postman or cURL. Below are the available endpoints:

1. Register Students

-   Endpoint: POST /api/register
    
-   Headers: Content-Type: application/json
    
-   Request Body Example:
    
    json
    
    ```json
    {
      "teacher": "teacherken@gmail.com",
      "students": ["studentjon@gmail.com", "studenthon@gmail.com"]
    }
    ```
    
-   Success Response: 204 No Content
    

2. Get Common Students

-   Endpoint: GET /api/commonstudents?teacher=teacherken@gmail.com

-   Success Response (HTTP 200):
    
    json
    
    ```json
    {
      "students": ["commonstudent1@gmail.com", "commonstudent2@gmail.com"]
    }
    ```
    

3. Suspend a Student

-   Endpoint: POST /api/suspend
    
-   Headers: Content-Type: application/json
    
-   Request Body Example:
    
    json
    
    ```json
    {
      "student": "studentmary@gmail.com"
    }
    ```
    
-   Success Response: 204 No Content
    

4. Retrieve Notification Recipients

-   Endpoint: POST /api/retrievefornotifications
    
-   Headers: Content-Type: application/json
    
-   Request Body Example:
    
    json
    
    ```json
    {
      "teacher": "teacherken@gmail.com",
      "notification": "Hello students! @studentagnes@gmail.com @studentmiche@gmail.com"
    }
    ```
    
-   Success Response (HTTP 200):
    
    json
    
    ```json
    {
      "recipients": ["studentbob@gmail.com", "studentagnes@gmail.com", "studentmiche@gmail.com"]
    }
    ```
    

Error Handling

-   For invalid requests, expect a response like:
    
    json
    
    ```json
    {
      "message": "Invalid email format"
    }
    ```
    
    With an appropriate HTTP status code (e.g., 400 Bad Request).

----------

This README.md provides clear instructions for setting up, running, and testing the API locally, meeting the assessment's requirements. It assumes a typical NodeJS project structure with Express for routing, MySQL for the database, and Jest for unit tests. You can adapt the specifics (e.g., GitHub URL, deployment link) based on your actual implementation. Let me know if you'd like help with the code itself!
